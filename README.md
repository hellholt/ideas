A repository just for ideas, since I'm having them faster than I can finish them...

- A debugger where you select a couple of lines and a static analyzer determines and allows you to provide values for in-scope variables in normal code
- A command where you run it, e.g. my_tool ping www.google.com, and it pops up an interface that's constructed on the fly from the man page or online help. It shows a field for each variable along with the variable's name, information, etc. So you can run any commands from a GUI just by running the tool followed by the commands. It might even open up a row of screens for pipelines that would allow you to customize each. Then you click "OK" and it drops you back off at the command line with the altered command.
